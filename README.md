# Advent of Code 2024

Trying out Advent of Code in C++ to learn the language better.

- Day 1: [1.cpp](day1/1.cpp) [2.cpp](day1/2.cpp)
- Day 2: [1.cpp](day2/1.cpp) [2.cpp](day2/2.cpp)
- Day 3: [1.cpp](day3/1.cpp) [2.cpp](day3/2.cpp)

## Self Leaderboard

I usually do Advent of Code after my college hours so I don't 
compete on the global leaderboard. I just keep track of my own times.
